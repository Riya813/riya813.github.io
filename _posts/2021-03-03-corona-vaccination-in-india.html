        >Corona vaccination was launched in India on 16th January across 3,000
        vaccination centres. Coronavirus is a contagious disease caused by severe
        acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. The first case was identified in
        Wuhan, China at the end of year 2019. Since then the virus has spread
        worldwide. There are many symptoms of CoronaVirus ranging from mild to
        severe illness. Many infected people develop mild to severe symptoms while
        some do not see any noticeable symptoms at any point of time. Covid-19
        vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against virus causing
        disease.&nbsp;</span

          >India's drug regulatory agency has given green light to COVID-19 vaccine named Covishield and Covaxin. Covaxin is a government backed vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. Whereas, Covishield is manufactured locally by Serum Institute of India. Each vaccination centre will offer either of them but not both. Most of the states in India are giving preference to Covishield and keeping Covaxin for buffer stock as Covaxin has not completed phase-3 trials. Those who receive Covaxin dose will have to sign a signed consent form.&nbsp;</span
