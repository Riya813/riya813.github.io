      >This film revolves around the fantasy land or realm of Kumandra and
      currently in the news as it is inspired by Southeast Asian culture. Raya
      and the last dragon film is criticized due to lack of southeast asian cast
      representation. Most of the cast is of East Asian heritage. Kumandra realm
      is a re-imagined earth which is inhabited by ancient civilisation. Raya
      played by Kelly Marie Tran is a princess warrior and in order to save her
      Realm from plague known as Drunn, she must find the famous last
      dragon.</span

      >The story of Raya and the last dragon is written by Qui Nguyen and Adele
      Lim. Raya is a magnificent martial Artist who’s been trained for the role
      of protecting the realm and a gem which has the last of Era’s Magic, after
      her Father played by Daniel Dae Kim. Kumandra is a beautiful kingdom
      filled with dragons and humans both. But after plague known as Drunn,
      coasted through the Kingdom, it turned everyone into stone. Then comes in
      picture the Last dragon named as Sisu played by Awkwafina, Sisu Made the
      last stand and tried to lift the curse of Drunn, he created a gem which is
      now guarded by Raya’s father. This gem defeated the Plague Drunn and
      transformed only the humans and not the dragons. Sisu sacrificed all her
      magic power to create this gem and went into hiding. People of Kumandra
      turned against each other as they were scared for the future. They start
      to fight over the Dragon gem which ultimately results in the division of
      Kumandra land into five parts.&nbsp; The five divided lands are named
      after the Dragon shape they lived next to - Fang, Spine, Heart, Tail and
      Talon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

      >Now, after five hundred years, these disagreements have turned deep and
      bitter. Everyone envy the keeper of Dragon’s gem - Raya’s Father. He
      believes that he can reunite and heal the rift between the people of
      Kumandra one day. So, he decides to invite leaders of each land for a
      sit-down. But a rival leader’s daughter Namaari played by Gemma Chan,
      befriends Raya with a motive of stealing the gem. Instead the gem got
      shattered into pieces and turned everyone into stone again. Raya escaped
      and travelled for six years to find the last dragon Sisu with the help of
      Tuk Tuk played by Alan Tudyk. Raya travelled through all five lands of
      Kumandra and made few friends including warrior giant played by Benedict
      Wong, con artist Noi played by Thalia Tran and her three little monkeys,
      Ship captain Boun played by Issac Wang and of course a water dragon sisu.
      Sisu is a beautiful and divine water being. She is a wacky teenage with
      undefeated divine magical power. Raya and Sisu are determined to fulfill
      Raya’s father's last wish to reunite all five landers of Kumandra. They
      Travelled all five lands in search of the remaining pieces of gem, in hope
      that uniting all the pieces can return the dragons and humans to Kumandra
      and lift the curse of Drunn once again.&nbsp;</span
