      >The Suez Canal is a man-made waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea to
      the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea. It enables a more direct route for
      shipping between Europe and Asia, effectively allowing for passage from the
      North Atlantic to the Indian Ocean without having to circumnavigate the
      African continent. </span

      >The original canal was a single-lane waterway with passing locations in the
      Ballah Bypass and the Great Bitter Lake. It had no lock systems with
      seawater flowing freely through it.</span

  </h3>
  <span style="font-family: verdana"
    >The idea of a large canal providing a direct route between the two bodies of
    water was first discussed in the 1830s.
    A French explorer and engineer Linant de Bellefonds, who specialized in Egypt,
    performed a survey of the Isthmus of Suez and confirmed that the Mediterranean
    and Red seas were, contrary to popular belief, at the same level of altitude.
    This meant a canal without locks could be built, making construction
    significantly easier.<br /><br />By the 1850s, seeing an opportunity for Egypt
    and the Ottoman Empire, which governed the country at the time, Khedive Said
    Pasha (who oversaw Egypt and the Sudan for the Ottomans) had granted French
    diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps permission to create a company to construct a
    canal. That company eventually became known as the Suez Canal Company, and it
    was given a 99-year lease over the waterway and surrounding area.<br /><br />Construction
    began, at the northernmost Port Said end of the canal, in early 1859. The
    excavation work took 10 years, and an estimated 1.5 million people worked on
    the project.<br />On November 17, 1869, Ismail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt
    and the Sudan, formally opened the Suez Canal<br /><br

    <span style="font-family: verdana"
      >According to the 1963 memorandum, which was declassified in 1996, the plan
      would have relied on 520 nuclear bombs to carve out the waterway. The memo
      called for the "use of nuclear explosives for excavation of Dead Sea canal
      across the Negev desert."</span

  <span style="font-family: verdana"
    >The plan never came to fruition, but having an alternative waterway to the
    Suez Canal could have been useful today, with a cargo ship stuck in the narrow
    path and blocking one of the world's most vital shipping routes.</span

      ><br />When the sea-level canal was first opened in 1869, it was 164
      kilometres (102 miles) long and eight metres (26 feet) deep.<br /><br />It
      could accommodate ships of up to 5,000 tons to a depth 6.7 metres, which
      constituted the bulk of the world's fleet at the time, according to the Suez
      Canal Authority.<br /><br />In 1887, the canal was modernised to allow
      navigation at night, which doubled its capacity.</span
