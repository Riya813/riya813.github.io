We must speak out against discrimination of all kind, reject the ignorant rhetoric driving the waves of violence, and reach out to support people.”</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">#StopAsianHate</span></p><br /></span>
