                  The Army has changed rules of engagement along the LAC (Line of
                  Actual Control) with China, empowering field commanders to
                  sanction use of firearms under ''extraordinary'' circumstances.
                  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier also said the Army has
                  been given full freedom to deal with the on-ground situation.
